So my first attempt at anything using a two dimensional array, a rendition of Game Of Life in Java - ended up having some of the worst memory leakage you’d ever see, to a point where that github repository is going to forever be placed in private.

Each team's cells were sharing the same pool of health, rather than inheriting and having their own health pools. This was due to referencing the same variable (whoops).
