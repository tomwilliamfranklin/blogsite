This would involve my own set of rules for each cell. First I had to actually get the cells to populate the map, so I set up an array for every single cell on the map along with an array with every single land cell on the map (By scanning the image for cells with the colour Green). Then I used both these arrays to set it so when a cell is next to a empty land tile, it will populate it with a cell of its own team. Once a bunch of cells from one team bumped into another team they came to a standstill, which is exactly what I wanted, because it means it recognised that the enemy cells were not empty pieces of land, as seen below.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block image-out-of-line\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><img src=\"/cf3cc787fb6e24a14b402d9f42bf0c6a/teams.gif\" alt=\"something\" title=\"image-inline maxwidth\">Gif of the teams in action</p></div></div>\n<p>Next I had to add combat, and this took the longest time, not because the difficulty of the code but more because I had no idea how to create a balanced combat system where one team couldn't just conquer the entire map as soon as they had got going, first I tried to get them to fight on an equal playing field..</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block image-out-of-line\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><img src=\"/a147b8e3acdad3eff0dc7a1e34d6c8e9/attempt1.gif\" alt=\"attempt1\" title=\"image-outline\">The first attempt didn't fair so well...</p></div></div>\n<p>This ended up looking more like a animated Piet Mondrian art piece than an empires automation, and something didn't feel right, it was as if all the cells had the same health... which they did. I accidently had set the new \"child\" cells health as a direct pointer to the parents health, rather than creating a new one. Not only that but it felt like I needed to give more chance in whether they win or lose, more than just \"if health is bigger, kill\" and as such I added a random number from 1 - 6 which would add to the cells health divided 100 (Cells health would go up in 100s), this lead to the teams living in harmony</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block image-out-of-line\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><img src=\"/836a53d64df06154c50dd9568e2e4444/attempt2.gif\" alt=\"attempt2\" title=\"image-outline\"> You guys are meant to fight.. not this</p></div></div>\n<p>What was going wrong this time? Well for starters instead of replacing the enemy cells upon winning a battle, i was lazily reusing a \"kill\" function from earlier in development, which replacland with empty land, allowing either team to refill it. This wasn't the only issue, it seemed as if neither team could ever win due to the balance of the dice system. So I decided I needed a few more elements, first was \"Age\" where each frame every cell would increase in age by one, if their age reached about 50, they rolled a dice of their age, if it landed above 50, they died. I didn't want this to be an absolute as it caused a mexican wave of deaths, with cells of 50 all dying at the same time (did not seem very natural). Further I made the fighting a bit more one sided, as well as the dice and their health, the overall cell count of the team would be taken into account, divided by 100,000 (It just works..) I had to also increase the dice to around 10000 for good measure, and the end result can be seen in the lovely example below.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block blog-page-image-out\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/86ef6/empires.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"final\"\n        title=\"image-inline\"\n        src=\"/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/799d3/empires.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/00d96/empires.png 148w,\n/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/0b23c/empires.png 295w,\n/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/799d3/empires.png 590w,\n/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/2a3d6/empires.png 885w,\n/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/ae92f/empires.png 1180w,\n/static/0f67681178e079f3ca8ec953f0c0dc95/86ef6/empires.png 1620w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>The end result.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"custom-block blog-page-button\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><a href=\"/examples/empires/empires.html\">View the final version here</a></p></div></div>","frontmatter":{"date":"20-December-2019","title":"Cellular Automata","path":"/CellAutomata","published":true,"summary":"Over the last few weeks I have spent time looking at Cellular Automation, as it looked like a fasinating idea which can both produce beautiful patterns and improve my overall knowledge of the algorithms involved.","inprogress":true,"context":"A Personal Project","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/c30d9f2454ef1f8c1fc8c2f3158dd2c6/ddb9e/ca3.png","srcSet":"/static/c30d9f2454ef1f8c1fc8c2f3158dd2c6/59beb/ca3.png 200w,\n/static/c30d9f2454ef1f8c1fc8c2f3158dd2c6/c0bbd/ca3.png 400w,\n/static/c30d9f2454ef1f8c1fc8c2f3158dd2c6/ddb9e/ca3.png 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"html":"<h4>This post is in ongoing development!
