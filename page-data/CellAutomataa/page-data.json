A popular example of Cellular Automation was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway's Game of Life</a> also known as just the \"Game of Life\" due to comparisons on how the cells live and die based on under/over population. I felt this would be a good first step into the realm of the subject so I decided to try and replicate it. The outcome was a successful application built using just Javascript and a library known as <a href=\"https://p5js.org/\">p5.js</a> which provides functionality for drawing on html canvas'.
