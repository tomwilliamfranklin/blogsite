###The Module Chooser Application is an application which allows the user to enter their details, select modules for their specific course and then save the selected modules.

<!--&nbsp;-->

The Module Chooser Application was developed for the Object-Oriented Programming module in my second year of University. 

The application allows the user to enter their details, specifically, it allows them to enter which course theyâ€™re picking for. Once their course is selected, the second page of the application displays the modules relevant to that course as well as any compulsory modules. 

The user can select the modules dependant on the maximum amount of credits allowed for said course. Once this is all done the user can go to the 3rd page where they can review all information entered and then save it to a text file.

I scored an overall **grade of 77%** meeting the first-class honours grade boundary requirement.
