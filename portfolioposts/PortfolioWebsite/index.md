The Module Chooser Application was developed for the Object-Oriented Programming module in my second year of University. The application allows the user to enter their details, specifically, it allows them to enter which course theyâ€™re picking for. Once their course is selected, the second page of the application displays the modules relevant to that course, as well as any compulsory modules. The user can then select the modules dependant on the maximum amount of credits allowed for said course. Once this is all done the user can go to the 3rd page where they can review all information entered and then save it to a text file.


This module was my first introduction into Java programming and allowed me to get to grips with a lot of the different techniques used in Object Orientated programming. The program was developed in Java, following the MVC design-pattern. It received an overall grade of 77%, meeting the First-Class Honours level percentage requirement.
