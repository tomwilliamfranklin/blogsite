###My Portfolio Website was created to document my future projects and practice my front-end skills.

<!--&nbsp;-->

The latest version of the site uses [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which is based on React. This was chosen due to its unrivaled speed in loading times, as well as its natural focus on blogsites and portfolios.

GraphQL being part of the GatsbyJS framework, is used throughout the site to process data. All blog posts and portfolio posts are written in markdown, and are processed into web pages using GraphQL.
