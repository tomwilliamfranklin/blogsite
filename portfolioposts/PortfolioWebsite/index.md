###My Portfolio Website was created to document my future projects and practice my front-end skills.

<!--&nbsp;-->

It is in ongoing development as I develop new skills. The latest iteration of the site was built using GatsbyJS (React), due to its unrivaled speed in building and loading static web applications, along with one of its most prominent use cases, blog and portfolio sites. 

As part of using GatsbyJS, GraphQL was also used for dynamic data fetching with each blog and portfolio post on the site being dynamically generated from markdown files. A big improvement on my previous site which was built using vanilla html, css and javascipt; Which as such meant I created a new html file for each and every portfolio / blog post. 

My current IDE of choice for development is Visual Studio Code due to its vast flexibility and community plugins, although I previously used Atom Text-Editor. You can find the git repository for my portfolio website here:
